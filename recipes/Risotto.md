Authentic Italian-style risotto cooked the slow and painful way, but oh so worth it. Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very well. Check the rice by biting into it. It should be slightly al dente (or resist slightly to the tooth but not be hard in the center).

## Ingredients

for 4 servings

- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, sliced
- 5 strips bacon, diced
- 8 oz wild mushrooms(225 g), such as porcini or shiitake, sliced
- 1 ½ cups arborio rice(300 g)
- ½ cup dry white wine(120 mL), such as Sauvignon Blanc
- 5 cups chicken broth(1.17 L)
- ½ cup parmesan cheese(55 g), plus more for garnish

## Preparation

1.  In a 5-quart Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
2.  Add the onion and cook 3-4 minutes until soft and slightly transparent.
3.  Add the bacon and stir constantly until it starts to crisp.
4.  Add the mushrooms and cook for an additional 2 minutes.
5.  Add the arborio rice and cook for one minute, stirring constantly so the oil coats the grains.
6.  Stir in the white wine and simmer 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7.  Add one cup (235ml) of the chicken stock and simmer over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
8.  Once the rice absorbs most of the liquid, continue to add 1-2 cups (235-470ml) of stock at a time until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is cooked through, about 25-30 minutes total.
9.  NOTE: The risotto should be al dente and fall back in on itself when you run the spoon along the bottom of the pot.
10. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and remove from the heat.
11. Serve and garnish with extra Parmesan cheese.
12. Enjoy!
